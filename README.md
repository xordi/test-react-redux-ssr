# React + Redux SSR (Server Side Rendering)
This is a Node application in which the front-end components are developed using React + Redux. The first request renders the resulting HTML in the server with an initial state (Server Side Rendering). 

Once the HTML is returned to the browser, the action takes place in the client only.

## Requirements
* NodeJS v8.9.4

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/xordi/test-react-redux-ssr.git

npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
